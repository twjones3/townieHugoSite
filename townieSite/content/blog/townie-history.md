Our mission is to improve the local transportation options of Orange County, NC BY PROVIDING A BETTER Travel EXPERIENCE. With over a decade of service, Townie has grown to meet specific Transportation needs of our community. we seek to provide the best service around with a focus on the community and the environment. 
Here is a little about where we started and where we are going. 

Townie began in 2013 with a few nice black Toyota Camrys. Established by Tony Shambley, who paired his vast knowledge of the transportation industry with his connections in Orange County to begin the company.  Tony sought to provide a nicer option for the community than the local cab companies had provided for many years.

In 2018, Taylor Jones purchased Townie. With the continued rapid changes in the transportation industry, including cheap rideshare services, Taylor saw a need to even further differentiate Townie. Competing with rideshare companies for short trips was no longer profitable, as it had completely taken over the cab and taxi market. He upgraded the fleet to Lexus vehicles and designed uniforms for the drivers. Townie began to provide more airport transportation. To further grow the business, he set up corporate accounts and established flourishing relationships with local businesses and venues. 

By 2020, Taylor had grown the fleet to 5 luxury vehicles and 10 drivers. During the pandemic emergence of 2020, Townie was able to adapt to remain in operations. However, by the 2nd year of the pandemic, Townie had lost most of its drivers and the fleet had been scaled back.  At this time, Taylor made the decision to leave the industry. 

In June of 2022, Jamie Tripp purchased Townie and established Townie Chauffeur and Shuttle LLC. As a long time employee and a committed leader of the company, Jamie had a vision to take the company electric. 

She began with only 2 cars and 2 drivers. Her goal was set to have a new electric vehicle added to the fleet within 6 months of business. Reaching her targeted timeline, a Tesla Model 3 was added to the fleet. With this addition, Townie became the first local transportation service with an electric option. At the end of the first year of business ownership, 2 Tesla Model Ys were added to the fleet and the work began to phase out non electric transportation options. 

Townie Chauffeur and Shuttle LLC, is committed to their vision to eventually use only EVs for local needs and airport transportation.

When you use Townie Chauffeur and Shuttle, you are investing in our goal to make a true difference towards a cleaner future for our community and beyond.
