Booking with Townie is simple and straightforward. If you're comfortable making a reservation, you're all set! We’ll keep you fully informed throughout your trip. However, if you'd like a deeper understanding of the process, feel free to explore more details below.

## 1. HOW DO I MAKE MY FIRST RESERVATION? 

To book your ride, simply click the blue “Book Now” button in the top right corner of the navigation bar. From there, enter your trip details and select either "To Airport" or "From Airport" for airport transfers, specifying RDU or CLT. Be sure to include your flight information so we can track your flight and ensure a timely pickup. For non-airport travel, choose “Point to Point,” or select “Hourly as Directed” if you’d like your driver to stay with you for an extended period with multiple stops.

Before checkout, you’ll have the option to create an account. While not required, having an account will give you access to manage your future and past trips, making adjustments as needed.

## 2: HOW CAN I KNOW MY RESERVATION IS CONFIRMED AND SECURE?

You'll have three levels of confirmation ensuring you are always aware of your reservations status.

1. You’ll first receive an email alerting you that we’ve received your booking request. Once our dispatcher confirms availability, a true confirmation email with your trip details will be sent. 

*Please allow time for a dispatcher to manually review this booking. If the dispatcher is away, or if it is past normal business hours, this may take some time. Rest assured we will contact you as early as possible if there is a problem.*


2. Two hours before your pickup, we’ll text you with your driver’s name, vehicle information, and their contact number.

3. You’ll also get two more texts—one when the driver is on the way and another upon arrival. These messages are sent manually to ensure they accurately reflect the driver’s status.

## 3. CAN I BE SURE MY DRIVER WILL ARRIVE ON TIME?

At Townie, we schedule with care to ensure there’s no overlap between bookings. After receiving ample confirmations to keep you up to date with your drivers status, your driver will arrive on time, prepared for your trip at the scheduled appointment. Don’t just take our word for it—check out our years of outstanding reviews. With a near-perfect 4.9-star rating across Google, Yelp, and Facebook, Townie is the highest-rated transportation service in the Triangle.

## 4. WHAT DIFFERENTIATES TOWNIE FROM OTHER SERVICES?

Townie is a locally-owned company based right here in Chapel Hill, with a strong focus on supporting local businesses and the community. While we may not operate large buses or stretch limos, that simply means our focus is on you! Your trip to RDU is our specialty, and we treat each ride with the utmost care—it’s the heart of our business.

Every trip is an opportunity to build a lasting relationship with our customers. But don’t worry, your driver won’t be overbearing. Whether you prefer a friendly conversation or quiet professionalism for a business call, we tailor your experience to meet your expectations.
