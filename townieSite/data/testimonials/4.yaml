text: "On rare occasions the right business model aligns with the right moment in time. I have used car services across the US and in fourteen foreign countries. The car service gap has always been between the taxi/Uber model and the luxury sedan. Townie, as the name conveys, fills the gap. They provide, reliability, professionalism, attention to detail and amazing comfort at a reasonable price. Every experience is marked by courtesy, polished details and on time service. Obviously, I am a fan and have used Townie for everyday travel and trips to Wilmington, Asheville, Raleigh, and Charlotte. Luxury treatment in a practical budget is what you can expect."
